# chore-rota
A simple household chore rota for 2 people.

## Dependencies
- This uses the `::-webkit-scrollbar` CSS pseudo-element, so [might not work on all browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar).

## TODO
- ~~Add function to get cleaningString for previous week~~
- ~~Show countdown timer for days left to complete chores~~
- Add button to mark tasks as done. Ideally this would be stored server-side so that it shows up for everyone using the rota. After a bit of research I think I can do this using Express and Node. TBC.
